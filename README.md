hoopale
=======

Hoopale is a JavaScript + PhP library developed by Ovnyline to power up web site development.

In Hoopale we have included all functions we normally use in web site development.

Hoopale needs jQuery and jQuery UI libraries to work, version 1.8 or higher.

We have no documentation yet, but we promise to finish it as soon as possible.

To use Hoopale, just download the full package from Github and copy "/hoopale" folder in your server root path.

Then load hoopale.js script in any page you need. Remember to load jQuery and jQuery UI scripts as well or Hoopale will not work.

`<script type="text/javascript" src="[root_path]/hoopale/hoopale.js"><script>`

Hoopale uses AJAX and plenty of HTML5 new features so older browsers (like Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 or lower) are not fully compatible.

Some features needs write permission to be allowed in "/hoopale" folder.

Any contribution, error detection or code improvement will be gratefully acepted.
