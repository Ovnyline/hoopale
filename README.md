hoopale
=======

Hoopale is a JavaScript + PhP library developed by Ovnyline to power up web site development.

In Hoopale we have included all functions we normally use in web site development.

Hoopale needsjJQuery and jQuery UI libraries to work, version 1.8 or higher.

We have no documentation yet, but we promise to finish it as soon as possible.

To use hoopale, just download the full package from Github and copy /hoopale folder in your server root path.

Then load hoopale.js script in any page you need. Remember to load jQuery and jQuery UI scripts as well or Hoopale will not work.
